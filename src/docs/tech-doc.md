# connectic Technical Implementation Document

## Problem Context

Modern JavaScript applications, particularly microfrontend architectures and complex React applications, struggle with fragmented communication patterns. Teams resort to prop drilling, complex context patterns, or framework-specific solutions that create vendor lock-in and maintenance challenges.

The core problem isn't technical capability - it's the lack of unified, type-safe communication patterns that work across different frameworks and application boundaries. Developers need to coordinate state changes, trigger cross-component workflows, and share business logic without tightly coupling their applications to specific frameworks or complex infrastructure.

**Real-world pain points:**
- MFE teams can't easily share cart state between product catalog (React) and checkout (Vue)
- Form validation logic gets duplicated across components with inconsistent error handling
- API calls become scattered throughout applications with no unified caching or error handling
- Cross-team coordination requires complex shared state management solutions
- Framework migrations become impossible due to tightly coupled communication patterns

## Solution Overview

**connectic** provides a framework-agnostic communication layer that enables both event-driven messaging and request/response patterns with built-in type safety, caching, and middleware support.

The solution follows a service-oriented architecture principle where components communicate through well-defined contracts rather than direct dependencies. This creates loose coupling while maintaining strong type safety and predictable behavior patterns.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **Framework independence:** Core library has zero framework dependencies
- **Type-first design:** TypeScript contracts define communication boundaries
- **Multiple communication patterns:** Support both pub/sub and request/response paradigms
- **Extensible middleware:** Plugin architecture for logging, validation, caching, and custom logic
- **Memory-safe:** Built-in cleanup mechanisms prevent memory leaks

**Why this approach works:**
Unlike existing solutions that focus on either state management (Redux) or basic event systems (EventEmitter), connectic provides both synchronous state sharing and asynchronous request/response patterns in a unified API. The type system ensures communication contracts are maintained across application boundaries while the plugin architecture allows teams to add custom behavior without modifying core functionality.

## Component Architecture

### System Overview

connectic follows a layered architecture where each layer handles specific concerns:

```
Application Layer (User Code)
    ↓
Public API Layer (index.ts)
    ↓
Communication Layer (pub/sub, request/response)
    ↓
State Management Layer (shared/computed state)
    ↓
Plugin/Middleware Layer (logging, validation, caching)
    ↓
Core Event Engine (event-bus.ts)
    ↓
Registry Layer (global instance management)
```

### Core Component Breakdown

**BusRegistry (registry.ts)**
Acts as the global singleton manager for bus instances. Handles cross-application communication by ensuring single instances are shared across different modules/applications.

"When multiple applications need to communicate, they must share the same bus instance. The registry ensures that `createBus({ name: 'global' })` returns the same instance regardless of which application calls it first. This is crucial for microfrontend communication where different bundled applications need to coordinate."

**EventBus (event-bus.ts)**
Provides the core pub/sub infrastructure using a Map-based subscriber system. Handles event emission, subscription management, and automatic cleanup.

"The EventBus uses a `Map<string, Set<Function>>` structure for O(1) event lookups and efficient subscriber management. Each event maintains its own Set of handlers, allowing for fast addition/removal without affecting other events."

**RequestResponseLayer (request-response.ts)**
Implements async request/response patterns over the event system using correlation IDs and Promise-based workflows.

"Request/response communication works by generating unique correlation IDs, emitting a request event with embedded ID, setting up a one-time response listener, and returning a Promise that resolves when the response arrives. Timeout handling and error scenarios are managed automatically."

**SharedState (shared-state.ts)**
Manages reactive state that automatically synchronizes across components and applications.

"SharedState implements the observer pattern where state changes trigger notifications to all subscribers. When state is updated via `setState()`, the system both notifies local subscribers and emits a bus event for cross-application synchronization."

**ComputedState (computed-state.ts)**
Provides derived state that automatically recalculates when dependencies change, similar to Vue's computed properties or MobX reactions.

"ComputedState tracks dependencies by monitoring which SharedState instances are accessed during computation. When any dependency changes, the computed value is marked as stale and recalculated on next access. This lazy evaluation prevents unnecessary computations while maintaining reactive updates."

**MiddlewareSystem (middleware.ts)**
Implements a plugin architecture allowing custom logic injection at various lifecycle points.

"The middleware system provides hooks at key points: beforeEmit, afterEmit, beforeOn, afterOn. Plugins can modify payloads, add validation, implement logging, or cancel operations. This follows the Express.js middleware pattern where each plugin can call `next()` to continue or `cancel()` to halt processing."

**CacheLayer (cache.ts)**
Manages intelligent request caching with TTL, invalidation patterns, and multiple caching strategies.

"The cache system supports multiple strategies: cache-first returns cached data immediately, network-first tries the network then falls back to cache, and stale-while-revalidate returns cached data while updating in the background. TTL-based expiration and pattern-based invalidation ensure data freshness."

### Data Flow Architecture

**Event Flow:**
```
[Component A] → emit() → [EventBus] → [All Subscribers] → [Component B, C, D]
```

**Request/Response Flow:**
```
[Component A] → request() → [EventBus] → [Responder] → [Response] → [Component A Promise resolves]
```

**State Synchronization Flow:**
```
[Component A] → setState() → [SharedState] → [Local Subscribers + Bus Event] → [Cross-app Sync]
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Stage 1: Core Event Infrastructure

The foundation begins with a robust event system that handles subscriber management, memory cleanup, and error boundaries.

**Event Bus Implementation:**
The core EventBus uses a Map-based structure for optimal performance. Each event name maps to a Set of handler functions, providing O(1) event lookup and efficient subscriber management.

```typescript
class EventBus {
  private listeners = new Map<string, Set<Function>>()
  
  emit(event: string, payload: any) {
    const handlers = this.listeners.get(event)
    if (handlers) {
      handlers.forEach(handler => {
        try {
          handler(payload)
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error in handler for ${event}:`, error)
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

**Memory Management Strategy:**
Each subscription returns an unsubscribe function that removes the handler from the Set. When a Set becomes empty, it's removed from the Map to prevent memory leaks. Component unmounting or application teardown should call these unsubscribe functions.

**Error Isolation:**
Individual handler errors don't prevent other handlers from executing. Each handler is wrapped in a try/catch block, logging errors without breaking the event flow.

### Stage 2: Request/Response Layer

Building on the event foundation, the request/response system provides async communication patterns using correlation IDs and Promise-based workflows.

**Correlation ID Strategy:**
Each request generates a unique ID (timestamp + random string) embedded in the request payload. Responders must include this ID in their response, allowing the system to match responses to the correct Promise resolver.

**Timeout and Error Handling:**
Requests automatically timeout after a configurable period (default 10 seconds). The system throws specific error types with meaningful codes:
- `BusError(404)` when no responder is registered
- `BusError(408)` when requests timeout
- `BusError(403)` when middleware validation fails

**Response Multiplicity:**
The system supports both single-response (`request()`) and multi-response (`requestMany()`) patterns. Single responses resolve with the first response and ignore subsequent ones. Multi-response collects all responses within the timeout window.

### Stage 3: Reactive State Management

Shared state provides reactive data that automatically synchronizes across components and applications.

**State Synchronization Architecture:**
When `setState()` is called, the system performs two operations:
1. Notify all local subscribers immediately
2. Emit a bus event for cross-application synchronization

This dual approach ensures local updates are immediate while cross-app updates happen via the event system.

**Computed State Implementation:**
Computed state tracks dependencies by monitoring SharedState access during computation. A simple dependency tracking system records which state instances are read during computation, then subscribes to changes on those dependencies.

**Memory Management:**
Both SharedState and ComputedState provide `destroy()` methods that clean up subscriptions and remove references. This is crucial for preventing memory leaks in single-page applications with dynamic component lifecycles.

### Stage 4: Middleware and Plugin Architecture

The middleware system enables extensibility without modifying core functionality.

**Hook-Based Architecture:**
Plugins can register handlers for lifecycle events: beforeEmit, afterEmit, beforeOn, afterOn. Each hook receives the event name and payload, allowing for logging, validation, transformation, or cancellation.

**Plugin Installation:**
Plugins implement a simple interface with `install()` and optional `uninstall()` methods. The install method receives the bus instance and can register hooks, modify behavior, or add new methods.

**Built-in Plugin Examples:**
- **LoggerPlugin:** Logs all events and requests for debugging
- **ValidatorPlugin:** Validates payloads against schemas before emission
- **CachePlugin:** Implements intelligent caching for request/response patterns

### Stage 5: Advanced Features

**Namespacing Implementation:**
Namespaced buses provide scoped communication channels. `bus.namespace('user')` returns a new bus instance that automatically prefixes all events with 'user:'. This enables logical separation while maintaining underlying bus sharing.

**Caching Strategies:**
The cache system supports multiple strategies based on use case:
- **cache-first:** Optimizes for speed, returns cached data immediately
- **network-first:** Optimizes for freshness, tries network then cache
- **stale-while-revalidate:** Balances speed and freshness

**Batch Request Processing:**
`requestBatch()` executes multiple requests in parallel using `Promise.all()`, providing efficient bulk operations while maintaining individual error handling for each request.

## API Integration Patterns

### Type Safety Implementation

connectic achieves type safety through TypeScript mapped types and contract definitions.

**Event Contract Definition:**
Teams define event maps that specify payload types for each event:

```typescript
interface AppEvents {
  'user:login': { userId: string; email: string }
  'cart:updated': { items: CartItem[]; total: number }
}
```

**Request/Response Contracts:**
Request/response patterns use separate interfaces mapping request/response pairs:

```typescript
interface AppRequests {
  'get:user:profile': {
    request: { userId: string }
    response: { id: string; name: string; email: string }
  }
}
```

**Mapped Type Implementation:**
The bus uses TypeScript's mapped types to provide compile-time type checking:

```typescript
emit<K extends keyof EventMap>(event: K, payload: EventMap[K]): void
request<K extends keyof RequestMap>(event: K, payload: RequestMap[K]['request']): Promise<RequestMap[K]['response']>
```

### Cross-Application Communication

**Microfrontend Integration:**
Multiple applications can share bus instances by ensuring the same registry name. The first application to call `createBus({ name: 'global' })` creates the instance; subsequent calls return the existing instance.

**Module Federation Compatibility:**
The library works with Webpack Module Federation by marking connectic as a shared singleton dependency:

```javascript
shared: {
  'connectic': { singleton: true, eager: true }
}
```

**Framework Integration Strategies:**
While the core library is framework-agnostic, teams can create framework-specific adapters:
- React: Custom hooks that manage subscriptions and cleanup
- Vue: Composables that integrate with Vue's reactivity system
- Angular: Services that wrap bus functionality in observables

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Comprehensive Error Management

**Error Type Hierarchy:**
connectic defines specific error types with HTTP-style status codes for consistent error handling:

```typescript
class BusError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public busCode: BusErrorCode, public details?: any)
}
```

**Request Timeout Handling:**
When requests timeout, the system cleans up Promise resolvers and removes temporary listeners to prevent memory leaks. Timeout errors include details about the event and timeout duration.

**Middleware Error Handling:**
If middleware throws errors, the system captures them and either logs warnings (for non-critical middleware) or throws BusError(403) for validation failures that should halt processing.

### Real-World Edge Cases

**Rapid Event Emission:**
High-frequency events (like scroll or mousemove) can overwhelm the system. The middleware architecture allows teams to add debouncing or throttling plugins as needed.

**Network Failures During Requests:**
Request/response patterns handle network-like failures by implementing retry logic with exponential backoff. Teams can configure retry attempts and fallback strategies.

**Cross-Tab Communication:**
When multiple browser tabs need to coordinate, teams can extend the system with BroadcastChannel API integration, treating each tab as a separate application sharing the same bus name.

**Memory Pressure Scenarios:**
Large applications with many subscribers can create memory pressure. The system provides utilities to monitor subscriber counts and implements automatic cleanup for unused event channels.

**State Synchronization Conflicts:**
When multiple applications modify shared state simultaneously, last-write-wins semantics apply. Teams needing conflict resolution can implement custom middleware for more sophisticated coordination.

## Testing & Validation Strategy

### Testing Philosophy

connectic testing follows the principle of testing behavior, not implementation. Tests focus on communication patterns, error scenarios, and integration points rather than internal data structures.

**Unit Testing Strategy:**
- Event emission and subscription behavior
- Request/response timeout and error handling
- State synchronization across subscribers
- Middleware execution order and error handling
- Cache behavior with different strategies

**Integration Testing:**
- Cross-bus communication scenarios
- Multi-responder request handling
- Concurrent state updates
- Plugin interaction and conflict resolution
- Memory cleanup during component lifecycle

**Performance Testing:**
- High-frequency event emission performance
- Memory usage with large numbers of subscribers
- Request/response latency under load
- Cache hit ratios and memory usage
- Bundle size impact analysis

### Edge Case Validation

**Error Recovery Testing:**
- Network timeout simulation for request/response
- Responder failures and error propagation
- Invalid payload handling in middleware
- Memory leak detection with rapid subscribe/unsubscribe cycles

**Concurrency Testing:**
- Simultaneous request/response from multiple sources
- Rapid state updates from different components
- Plugin installation during active communication
- Bus destruction during pending requests

**Browser Compatibility Testing:**
- Event emission in different JavaScript engines
- Memory cleanup in various browsers
- Performance characteristics across platforms
- Mobile browser behavior and limitations

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Security Patterns

**Payload Validation:**
The middleware system enables payload validation before event emission or request processing. Teams can implement schema validation, sanitization, and access control through custom plugins.

**Cross-Origin Communication:**
When used in microfrontend architectures with different origins, the system can be extended with postMessage-based communication for secure cross-origin coordination.

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
The library doesn't persist data by default, but teams using caching features should be aware of sensitive data storage. Cache implementations can be configured to exclude sensitive data types or implement encryption.

### Privacy Implementation

**Data Lifecycle Management:**
All data flows through the system without persistent storage unless explicitly cached. Teams can implement data retention policies through middleware that automatically purges sensitive information after specified timeouts.

**Audit Trail Capabilities:**
The plugin architecture supports audit logging where all communication events are logged for compliance purposes. This can be implemented as a middleware plugin without modifying core functionality.

**Memory Cleanup:**
The system provides explicit cleanup methods (`destroy()`, cache clearing) ensuring sensitive data can be purged from memory when required by privacy regulations.

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management Strategy

**Subscription Cleanup:**
Each subscription returns an unsubscribe function that removes handlers from the internal Map structure. Unused event channels are automatically removed when their subscriber count reaches zero.

**State Reference Management:**
SharedState and ComputedState implementations use WeakRef where supported to allow garbage collection of unused state instances while maintaining active subscriptions.

**Cache Size Management:**
The cache system implements LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policies to prevent unlimited memory growth. Teams can configure maximum cache sizes and automatic cleanup intervals.

### Performance Optimization Techniques

**Event Batching:**
High-frequency events can be batched using middleware that collects multiple events and emits them in groups, reducing overhead for scenarios like real-time data updates.

**Lazy State Initialization:**
Computed state uses lazy evaluation, only recalculating values when accessed rather than immediately when dependencies change. This prevents unnecessary computations for unused derived state.

**Request Deduplication:**
The cache system implements automatic request deduplication, where multiple identical requests share the same Promise, reducing redundant API calls and improving performance.

## Migration & Integration Strategies

### Gradual Adoption Patterns

**Legacy System Integration:**
connectic can be introduced gradually by wrapping existing communication patterns. Teams can migrate from prop drilling or context patterns one component at a time while maintaining existing functionality.

**Framework Migration Support:**
The framework-agnostic design enables gradual migration between frameworks. Shared business logic can move to connectic-based services while UI components are migrated separately.

**API Layer Migration:**
Existing API calling patterns can be gradually moved behind connectic request/response patterns, centralizing error handling, caching, and retry logic without changing component interfaces.

### Team Collaboration Patterns

**Contract-First Development:**
Teams can define event and request contracts before implementation, enabling parallel development where different teams can work on producers and consumers independently.

**Plugin Development:**
Custom plugins can be developed by different teams to handle organization-specific requirements (logging, authentication, monitoring) without modifying the core library.

**Testing Strategy Coordination:**
Shared contracts enable better testing strategies where teams can mock communication boundaries and test components in isolation while maintaining integration confidence.
