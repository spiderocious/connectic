# connectic - Product Documentation

## Product Overview

**connectic** is a framework-agnostic communication library that enables seamless event-driven communication and reactive state management across any JavaScript application. Whether you're building microfrontends, complex React applications, or need clean service-layer abstraction, connectic provides the infrastructure for reliable, type-safe communication patterns.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Challenges

**Microfrontend Communication Complexity:**
- Different MFEs struggle to share state and communicate
- Complex coordination required for cross-app workflows
- No standardized patterns for request/response communication
- Type safety lost across application boundaries

**State Management Sprawl:**
- Multiple state management libraries within single applications
- Difficulty sharing utilities and services across components
- Async communication patterns require complex boilerplate
- No unified approach for reactive state updates

**Framework Lock-in:**
- Solutions tied to specific frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Difficult to migrate or share logic across different tech stacks
- Team knowledge becomes framework-specific instead of pattern-focused

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: E-commerce Microfrontends**
- Product catalog (React) needs to notify shopping cart (Vue) about items added
- Checkout process (Angular) requires user authentication status from auth service
- Search functionality needs to trigger analytics events across all MFEs

**Scenario 2: Complex React Application**
- Form validation logic scattered across multiple components
- API calls duplicated with different error handling patterns
- Shared utilities imported individually creating bundle bloat
- Cross-component communication through prop drilling or complex context

**Scenario 3: Service-Oriented Architecture**
- Centralized API layer needed but framework-agnostic
- Utility functions should be accessible like services
- Need request/response patterns with proper error handling
- Type safety across service boundaries

## Solution Architecture

### Core Design Principles

**Framework Agnostic:** Works in vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, or any JavaScript environment without framework-specific dependencies.

**Type-Safe Communication:** Full TypeScript support with contract-based communication ensuring compile-time safety across application boundaries.

**Multiple Communication Patterns:** Support for both fire-and-forget pub/sub events and request/response patterns with timeouts, retries, and error handling.

**Reactive State Management:** Shared state that automatically synchronizes across components/applications with subscription-based updates.

**Plugin Architecture:** Extensible middleware system for logging, validation, caching, and custom business logic.

### Why "connectic"?

The name "connectic" combines "connect" + "ic" (like logic, static, etc.), emphasizing the core purpose: connecting different parts of applications through clean, logical patterns. It's:

- **Memorable:** Short, tech-friendly name
- **Global-friendly:** Easy to pronounce in any language
- **Purpose-driven:** Clearly indicates connection/communication
- **Professional:** Suitable for both indie projects and enterprise adoption

## Key Features & Differentiators

### Communication Patterns

**Pub/Sub Events:**
```typescript
// Fire-and-forget communication
bus.emit('user:login', { userId: '123', email: 'user@example.com' })
bus.on('cart:updated', (cart) => updateCartUI(cart))
```

**Request/Response:**
```typescript
// Async communication with responses
const user = await bus.request('get:user:profile', { userId: '123' })
const validation = await bus.request('validate:email', { email: 'test@example.com' })
```

**Batch Requests:**
```typescript
// Efficient parallel requests
const [user, preferences, permissions] = await bus.requestBatch([
  ['get:user', { id: '123' }],
  ['get:preferences', { id: '123' }],
  ['get:permissions', { id: '123' }]
])
```

### Reactive State Management

**Shared State:**
```typescript
// Cross-component reactive state
const cartState = bus.createState('cart', [])
cartState.subscribe(items => updateUI(items))
cartState.set([...items, newItem])
```

**Computed State:**
```typescript
// Derived state that updates automatically
const cartTotal = bus.createComputed(() => {
  return cartState.get().reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
})
```

### Advanced Features

**Middleware System:**
```typescript
// Extensible plugin architecture
bus.use(new LoggerPlugin())
   .use(new ValidationPlugin(schemas))
   .use(new CachePlugin({ ttl: 300000 }))
```

**Smart Caching:**
```typescript
// Intelligent request caching
const user = await bus.request('get:user', { id: '123' }, {
  cache: { ttl: 300000, strategy: 'stale-while-revalidate' }
})
```

**Namespacing:**
```typescript
// Scoped communication channels
const userBus = bus.namespace('user')
userBus.emit('profile:updated', data) // Actually emits 'user:profile:updated'
```

## Competitive Analysis

### vs. Redux/Zustand
